# Confusion-Matrix

Let a C is the confusion matrix of a multi class classification problem of (10*10).
It means there are 10 lables. Using this mtarix we cam easily calculates thePrecision, Accuracy, Recall and F1-Score Calculation from the Confusion matrix for multiclass classification.

Accuracy=  (TP+TN)/(TP+FP+FN+TN)                 
Precision= TP/(TP+FP)                            
Recall=TP/(TP+FN)                                
F1 score= (2×Precision×Recall)/(Precision+Recall)
Where TP, FP, FN, and TN representing the number of true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative outcomes, respectively.
